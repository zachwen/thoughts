### Introduction

The problem: given a dictionary of `c` patterns of average size `m`, find in the string `s` of size `n` every occurrence of any pattern.

---

The most brute-force approach: for every pattern `p`, starting from every index of `s`, check if there is a match.

Time complexity: $$O(cmn)$$

---

The second most brute-force approach: for every pattern `p`, apply KMP algorithm on `s`.

Time complexity: $$O(c(m + n))$$

---

The rock-n-roll approach: construct the Aho-Corasick DFA (deterministic finite automaton) and use that to search through `s`.

Time complexity: $$O(cm + km + n)$$ where `k` is the actual occurrence number of all the occurrences

---

The last approach is called Aho-Corasick algorithm. 

The Aho-Corasick algorithm is an extension of the KMP algorithm. It is also called "A-C automaton" or "A-C DFA" by many, but A-C DFA is actually only the data structure on which the algorithm runs. That is, it is conceptually wrong to call the algorithm "A-C automaton". Still, the actual algorithm is trivial compared to the implementation of the data structure.

The Aho-Corasick DFA data structure is the equivalent of the LPS (Longest proper Prefix Suffix) array used in KMP.

#### Class Definition

Let's create a new class for the A-C DFA (automaton).

```c++
// include all the required STL dependencies here...
// also namespace...

class ACAutomaton {
private:
    struct Trie {
        Trie* children[26] = {0};
        Trie* fail = 0;
        int level = -1;
    };
    Trie* trie;
    void buildTrie(vector<string> patterns);
    void buildFailurePointers();
public:
    ACAutomaton(vector<string> patterns); // calls buildTrie and buildFailurePointers
    vector<pair<int, int>> search(string text);
};
```

In above code, the inner struct `Trie` is just the normal Trie definition. The `fail` pointer's usage will be explained in later sections. The member `level` is a matter of design choice, and it's very versatile. In normal Trie it's usually just an `int` or `bool` marking the end of a word, but here I choose to store the length of the word, making it easier to find the offset of the word in the text.

Private member `trie` is the root of the Trie structure. Member function `buildTrie` and `buildFailurePointers` respectively build the basic Trie, and the more advanced core part of the A-C DFA. Both functions are called in the constructor `ACAutomaton`.

#### Trie

The first step of A-C algorithm is to construct a Trie using the dictionary patterns, which serves as the skeleton for the A-C DFA.

```c++

void ACAutomaton::buildTrie(vector<string> patterns) {
    trie = new Trie();
    for (int i = 0; i < patterns.size(); ++i) {
        Trie* t = trie;
        for (char c : patterns[i]) {
            if (!(t->children[c - 'a']))
                t->children[c - 'a'] = new Trie();
            t = t->children[c - 'a'];
        }
        t->level = patterns[i].size();
    }
}
```

#### Failure Redirection Pointers

Constructing the failure redirection pointers is the key step, much like constructing the LPS array for KMP, only extended into a graph.

Like the name suggests, the failure pointer within every Trie node redirects the current pointer in case the strings no longer match. The failure redirection pointer at each Trie node takes the current pointer to a node, which is:

**The ending of a longest prefix (of current or another word) which is also a proper suffix of the current word.**

Remember that Trie is also called "prefix tree", so prefix is just a path starting from root.

Similar to the DP iterative approach that constructs the LPS array, this DFA is constructed using BFS from the root. Note that how for each node we are setting the **failures of current children to the children of a current or previous failure**. Last sentence sums up the essence of this construction, reminiscent of how we construct the LPS array using the existing LPS entries. Yes, this is the tree version of DP, using BFS (or level order traversal).

```c++
void ACAutomaton::buildFails() {
    queue<Trie*> q;
    q.push(trie);
    while (!q.empty()) {
        Trie* t = q.front();
        q.pop();
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; ++i) {
            if (t->children[i]) {
                q.push(t->children[i]);
                if (t == trie) {
                    t->children[i]->fail = trie;
                    continue;
                }
                Trie* f = t->fail;
                while (f) {
                    if (f->children[i]) {
                        t->children[i]->fail = f->children[i];
                        break;
                    }
                    f = f->fail;
                }
                if (!f)
                    t->children[i]->fail = trie;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### Using the DFA

Before that, there is the constructor.

```c++
ACAutomaton(vector<string> patterns) {
    buildTrie(patterns);
    buildFails();
}
```

The following is the entry point of the A-C algorithm. Iterate through the string `s` keeping track of the constructed DFA. The path from the current pointer `t` to root `trie` is the equivalent of the sliding window in KMP.

```c++
vector<pair<int, int>> ACAutomaton::search(string text) {
    int n = text.size();
    Trie* t = trie;
    vector<pair<int, int>> res;
    for (int i = 0; i < n;) {
        if (t->children[text[i] - 'a']) {
            t = t->children[text[i] - 'a'];
            if (t->level >= 0)
                res.push_back(make_pair(i + 1 - t->level, t->level));
            ++i;
            continue;
        }
        t = t->fail;
        if (t) {
            if (t->level >= 0)
                res.push_back(make_pair(i - t->level, t->level)); // index pitfall here
        }
        else {
            t = trie;
            ++i;
        }
    }
    return res;
}
```

Usage of the `ACAutomaton` class:

```
int main() {
    ACAutomaton ac({"he", "she", "his", "hers"});
    string text = "ahisshershers";
    vector<pair<int, int>> ocs = ac.search(text);
    for (auto oc : ocs)
        cout << "[" << text.substr(oc.first, oc.second) << "] occurs at index " << oc.first << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

Above code should output:

```
[his] occurs at index 1
[she] occurs at index 4
[he] occurs at index 5
[hers] occurs at index 5
[she] occurs at index 8
[he] occurs at index 9
[hers] occurs at index 9
```

### End

The ingenuity of A-C algorithm is: the Trie part of prevents potential redundant calculation among the dictionary patterns, and the Failure Redirectional Pointers part prevents potential redundant calculation among the string being searched, and together they form a DFA capable of linear time search for multiple patterns in a body text.
